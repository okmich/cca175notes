PROBLEM FORMULA
=======================
Data dumps from a trading system is periodically downloads to flat files at a shared location /home/cloudera/Downloads/shared_files.
Write a system that transfers all the files downloaded to the share folder to a hdfs location /user/cloudera/output/flume/price_data with the following properties.
- The size of each file in the final destination should not exceed one hdfs block size
- Files could rollover every 5 mins
- Each file should not contain more than 100000 records
- All files in the final location should have their file names prefixed with trade_data
- All transfered files should be in the format that they were read
- No data loss should be allowed even with restart of the transfering system
- Files should be read by oldest first 
- No duplicates during transfer of data
- Your submission for data transfer should be left running even after the exams ends
- You can delete all files from the shared folder after they have been successfully read
